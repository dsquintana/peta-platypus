abstract: We have conducted the first study of sleep in the platypus Ornithorhynchus
  anatinus. Periods of quiet sleep, characterized by raised arousal thresholds, elevated
  electroencephalogram amplitude and motor and autonomic quiescence, occupied 6–8h/day.
  The platypus also had rapid eye movement sleep as defined by atonia with rapid eye
  movements, twitching and the electrocardiogram pattern of rapid eye movement. However,
  this state occurred while the electroencephalogram was moderate or high in voltage,
  as in non-rapid eye movement sleep in adult and marsupial mammals. This suggests
  that the low-voltage electroencephalogram is a more recently evolved feature of
  mammalian rapid eye movement sleep. Rapid eye movement sleep occupied 5.8–8h/day
  in the platypus, more than in any other animal. Our findings indicate that rapid
  eye movement sleep may have been present in large amounts in the first mammals and
  suggest that it may have evolved in pre-mammalian reptiles.
